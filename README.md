## Overview

*Tyche's Hand* is a **dark, narrative-driven twist on blackjack** — heavily inspired by games like _Inscryption_ and _Balatro_.

You play as **The Gambler**, an unnamed figure who awakens in the decaying husk of a forgotten casino. To escape, you must outwit an ancient being who holds your life on the line.

Each round, you'll have the chance to earn **Tyche's blessing**: powerful tokens that grant unique abilities and reshape the rules of the game. You may also discover **cursed cards**, drawn from twisted decks — each capable of turning a desperate hand into victory.

But the being will not go down easily. With every encounter, it changes form — wielding new effects that bend the rules in its favor.

_**Uncover the daimon’s secret.**_  
_**Twist fate to your will.**_  
_**And maybe... just maybe — figure out why you're really here.**_
